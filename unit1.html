  <h1>Lesson #1  C.F.U </h1>
<p>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</p>
  
<p>In the first week of my new classes, I really just take my time to observe and learn how to easily do a topic, that means I take notes everyday in every class just to help me out remember what to do IF I am confused about that one topic, some of the students has similar problems especially on the first week, and always being tired making you forget what you were doing before, and grades are dropping dramatically but soon rise up as soon as you know how to do it.</p>
